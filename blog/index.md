###### *Sep 09, 2006*
> In this project, a working comprehensive software package is implemented that accomplished three main categories of challenges: parallel distributed genetic programming engine, financial stock market prediction, and a visualised distributed network interface. This project meets and beyond its initial specifications in many ways. Firstly, a generic Distributed Genetic Programming engine is developed, which can be applied to problem solving other than financial trading. Secondly, a financial genetic programming with various improvements to current research in this area has been achieved. This project suggests a new way to measure fitness value for financial activity is derived, and has its own approach on choosing technical indicators. Thirdly, a favourable graphic engine with frames animation is developed, which can be taken out as a separate component to be re-used in future project in other areas. Finally, this project presents a software product brings all these features together â€“ *GeneProfit*.
